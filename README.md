#ðŸ’¡ About Me
Hi, I'm Mahak Ganveer â€” a passionate Frontend Developer and creative Content Writer. I specialize in building responsive, visually engaging web interfaces using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like React.js. I blend technical skills with an artistic eye to deliver user-friendly and elegant websites.

My journey into tech began with a deep love for storytelling and design. Whether Iâ€™m writing content or coding, my focus is on clarity, usability, and creating experiences that connect with people.

I'm currently expanding my expertise into full-stack development with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), and I enjoy working on real-world projects that solve problems.

When I'm not coding or writing, youâ€™ll find me exploring design trends, tech blogs, or crafting ideas that bring digital creativity to life.
